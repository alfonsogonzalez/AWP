\section{Preface}

The \color{magenta}Astrodynamics with Python \color{white} book, YouTube videos, and GitHub repository are all products
of the simple belief that all information should be free to anyone with access to the internet.
They are collectively my attempt at providing useful information to the world.


Also because of that belief, if you'd like to help me by translating this project to your native language, don't hesitate
to contact me at: \color{magenta}spaceengineeringpodcast@gmail.com \color{white}


This book is unlike other books, given that (for now) it is solely electronic, is being released as its being written (chapter by chapter),
and will be a very iterative process (hence why it is being version controlled via Git). This is for multiple reasons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Free to anyone with access to the internet
	\item Easy to publish (git push, merge to main)
	\item This is a collaboration with other engineers who contribute by translating
	\item This is a collaboration with readers (you)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If you see a mistake or are confused by an explanation, reach out
		via email or open up Git Issue, so that when the book is updated, your
		Git Issue will be attached to the fix/improvement git commit, thus you will have
		directly contributed to this project!
		\item This applies to the book as well as the software in this repository.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Now lets get to the technical work.

\section{Chapters and Material}
The following are general guidelines of how this book will be written:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Visuals and software will be at the center of every explanation / derivation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In general, I don't consider myself to truly understand a problem until I can solve it on paper \textbf{AND} implement it in software.
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\noindent
The current plan is to separate the book by the following topics:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Orbital Mechanics
	\item Rocket Trajectories
	\item Numerical Methods
	\item Spacecraft Attitude Control
	\item Trajectory Optimization / Optimal Control
	\item SPICE
	\item Prerequisites
\end{itemize}
 
The book, videos, and software will all be complementing each other, and will be
continuously updated as needed / requested from the readers.

\subsection{Prerequisites}
This section will be left open to any requests from the readers (you) that don't exactly fit into any of the other sections.
Topics like what are vectors, derivatives, integrals,
